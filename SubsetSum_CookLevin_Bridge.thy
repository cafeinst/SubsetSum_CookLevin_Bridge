section \<open>Cook--Levin bridge for the subset-sum lower bound\<close>

text \<open>
This theory connects the abstract decision-tree lower bound developed in
\<open>SubsetSum_DecisionTree\<close> with the concrete operational semantics of
Turing machines, as defined in the AFP \emph{Cook\_Levin} library.

The objective of this file is structural.  Within the Cook--Levin framework,
we introduce an explicit information-flow interface, formalised below as
\emph{LR-read}, that exposes the same per-candidate informational structure
required by the abstract \(\sqrt{2^n}\) lower bound.

The development proceeds in several layers:

\begin{itemize}
\item We define a time measure \verb|steps_CL| together with acceptance
      predicates \verb|accepts_CL| and \verb|accepts_CL_halt| for Cook--Levin
      machines operating on Boolean inputs.  Inputs are written onto tape~0
      using the encoding function \verb|bool_to_symbols|.

\item Using these notions, we formalise SUBSET--SUM as a language in the
      Cook--Levin sense and give a verifier-based proof that SUBSET--SUM lies
      in \(\mathcal{NP}\) relative to any instance encoding \verb|enc0|
      that admits a verifier in the sense of the locale \verb|SS_Verifier_NP|.

\item We introduce a locale \verb|CL_SubsetSum_Solver| for a Turing machine
      \verb|M| and encoding \verb|enc| that together decide SUBSET--SUM
      correctly.  Inside this locale we obtain the specialised notions
      \[
        \verb|steps_TM as s| = \verb|steps_CL M (enc as s)|,
        \qquad
        \verb|read0_TM as s| = \verb|read0_CL M (enc as s)|,
      \]
      which specialise the Cook--Levin-level notions to SUBSET--SUM instances
      and serve as the concrete time and read measures for the later transfer
      of the lower bound.

\item Finally, the locale \verb|LR_Read_TM| states the assumptions needed to
      align the observable behaviour of \verb|M| with the canonical candidate
      sets used in the abstract lower bound.  Once these assumptions are made,
      the abstract \(\sqrt{2^n}\) bound transfers directly to
      \verb|steps_TM| and hence to \verb|steps_CL M|.
\end{itemize}

This theory does not, by itself, separate complexity classes.  It provides
only the Cook--Levin-side definitions and the LR-read interface required to
import the abstract decision-tree lower bound.  The conditional separation
\(\mathcal{P} \neq \mathcal{NP}\) is established later, in
\<open>SubsetSum_PneqNP\<close>.

As a preparatory step, we state an elementary analytic fact in the precise
numerical form needed later: polynomials bounded above by a ceiling function
are eventually strictly dominated by the function
\(n \mapsto 2 \cdot \sqrt{2^n}\).

lemma length_pow2_list[simp]: "length (pow2_list n) = n"
  by (simp add: pow2_list_def)

text \<open>
For each length \verb|n| we fix a canonical example with distinct subset sums,
namely \verb|pow2_list n|.  This family is convenient because for
\verb|as = pow2_list n| all \(2^n\) subset sums are different, and thus it
witnesses the existence of lists of length \verb|n| with pairwise distinct
subset sums.

The lower-bound argument itself does not depend on any special hardness
property of powers of~\(2\).  It uses only the abstract assumption that for
each \verb|n| there exist lists \verb|as| of length \verb|n| satisfying
\verb|distinct_subset_sums as|.  This assumption is captured formally by the
lemma \verb|exists_distinct_family_TM|.

subsection \<open>Basic encoding to Cook--Levin symbols\<close>

text \<open>
We use the standard Cook--Levin tape alphabet with the following conventions:

\begin{itemize}
\item symbol \verb|0| represents the blank symbol;
\item symbol \verb|1| represents the start symbol;
\item symbol \verb|2| represents the Boolean value \verb|0|;
\item symbol \verb|3| represents the Boolean value \verb|1|.
\end{itemize}

An input Boolean string is written on tape~0 as a sequence of symbols
\verb|2| and \verb|3|, using the encoding defined by
\verb|bool_to_symbols|.

subsection \<open>Cook--Levin step count and acceptance\<close>

text \<open>
We define a simple halting-time function \verb|steps_CL| together with the
acceptance predicates \verb|accepts_CL| and \verb|accepts_CL_halt| for
Cook--Levin machines.

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|steps_CL M x| is defined as the least time step \verb|t| such that
      the control-state index of the machine configuration is at least
      \verb|length M|.  This matches the halting convention used in the
      theory \<open>Cook_Levin.NP\<close>.

\item \verb|conf_CL M x t| denotes the configuration of machine \verb|M|
      after \verb|t| execution steps on input \verb|x|.

\item \verb|accepts_CL M x| holds if, at time \verb|steps_CL M x|, the symbol
      under the head on tape~1 is \verb|3|.  In other words, the output tape
      contains the symbol representing Boolean~\verb|1| under its head at
      halting time.
\end{itemize}

These are purely Cook--Levin--level notions.  They refer to an arbitrary
machine \verb|M| run on an arbitrary Boolean string
\verb|x :: bool list|, and make no reference to SUBSET--SUM or to any specific
instance encoding.

The definitions are intended for machines that halt on the relevant inputs.
In this development, halting is supplied implicitly by the solver and
time-bound assumptions introduced later, for example via an explicit halting
assumption or via a polynomial time-bound hypothesis.

text \<open>
The predicate \verb|accepts_CL_halt| is the notion of \emph{correct acceptance}
used when stating solver correctness.  It ensures that acceptance is asserted
only for computations that actually halt, avoiding any ambiguity arising from
partial or nonterminating executions.

In particular, all solver-correctness assumptions below are phrased in terms of
\verb|accepts_CL_halt| rather than \verb|accepts_CL| alone.
\<close>

text \<open>
We reason about Cook--Levin machines mainly via the abstract notions
\verb|steps_CL| and \verb|accepts_CL|, without unfolding low-level
configuration details.  Later, in the locale \verb|CL_SubsetSum_Solver|,
these Cook--Levin--level notions are specialised to SUBSET--SUM instances
\verb|(as, s)| via an encoding \verb|enc as s|, yielding the derived
quantities \verb|steps_TM| and \verb|read0_TM|.

subsection \<open>Which input bits does a Cook--Levin machine read?\<close>

text \<open>
The set \verb|read0_CL M x| collects all indices on the input tape (tape~0)
that the head visits before halting on input~\verb|x|.  This abstracts away
from the timing or frequency of visits and records only which input positions
the machine has actually inspected.

These Cook--Levin--level read-sets are raw observations of machine behaviour
on Boolean strings.  The LR-read interface introduced later in
\verb|LR_Read_TM| packages this low-level reading behaviour into
\emph{canonical} ``seen'' sets on the SUBSET--SUM side, aligned with the
LHS/RHS candidate families at a suitable split position.

subsection \<open>The mathematical SUBSET--SUM predicate\<close>

text \<open>
We now introduce the \emph{mathematical} SUBSET--SUM predicate, independent
of any machine model or input encoding.  It asks whether there exists a
$0/1$--vector \verb|xs| selecting a subset of \verb|as| whose weighted sum
is equal to the target value \verb|s|.

This predicate represents the underlying decision problem that our
Cook--Levin machines are intended to solve.

subsection \<open>Certificate-based view of SUBSET--SUM\<close>

text \<open>
A natural certificate for SUBSET--SUM is a $0/1$--vector \verb|xs| of length
\verb|length as| indicating which elements of the list \verb|as| are chosen.
The predicate \verb|ss_cert_ok as s xs| expresses the following conditions:

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|xs| has the correct length;
\item all entries of \verb|xs| are either \verb|0| or \verb|1|;
\item the weighted sum of the selected entries is equal to the target value
      \verb|s|.
\end{itemize}

The next lemma shows that this certificate notion is equivalent to the
predicate \verb|subset_sum_true|.  This equivalence is used later to prove
that SUBSET--SUM lies in \(\mathcal{NP}\) via a verifier machine in the
Cook--Levin framework.

subsection \<open>SUBSET--SUM is in NP (via an abstract verifier)\<close>

text \<open>
We now introduce an abstract verifier locale matching the
\verb|Cook_Levin.NP| characterisation of the class \(\mathcal{NP}\).

A verifier instance consists of the following components:

\begin{itemize}
\item an instance encoding \verb|enc0 :: int list ⇒ int ⇒ string|;
\item a certificate encoding
      \verb|enc_cert :: int list ⇒ int ⇒ int list ⇒ string|;
\item a Turing machine \verb|V| computing a Boolean verification function
      \verb|fverify|;
\item a polynomial bound \verb|p| on the certificate length as a function of
      the instance length; and
\item a time bound \verb|T| on the verifier computation.
\end{itemize}

The locale assumptions express that \verb|V| is a correct NP-style verifier
for SUBSET--SUM with respect to \verb|enc0| and \verb|enc_cert|:

\begin{itemize}
\item for every true SUBSET--SUM instance \verb|(as, s)|, there exists a
      certificate \verb|xs| such that the verifier accepts
      \verb|enc0 as s| together with \verb|enc_cert as s xs|;
\item whenever the verifier accepts an encoded instance and certificate,
      the corresponding certificate \verb|xs| satisfies the SUBSET--SUM
      specification.
\end{itemize}

From these assumptions we obtain the standard NP-membership statement
\[
  \verb|SUBSETSUM_lang enc0| \in \mathcal{NP},
\]
for any instance encoding \verb|enc0| admitting such a verifier.

subsection \<open>A Cook--Levin machine that solves SUBSET--SUM\<close>

text \<open>
The locale \verb|CL_SubsetSum_Solver| packages the basic assumptions for a
Cook--Levin Turing machine that decides SUBSET--SUM.

It is parameterised by:

\begin{itemize}
\item a machine \verb|M| that is well formed as a \verb|k_tapes| machine with
      start state \verb|q0|;
\item an encoding function \verb|enc| that maps instances \((as,s)\) to Boolean
      input strings;
\item a correctness condition stating that \verb|M| accepts exactly the
      encodings of true SUBSET--SUM instances:
      \[
        \verb|accepts_CL M (enc as s)| \;\longleftrightarrow\;
        \verb|subset_sum_true as s|.
      \]
\end{itemize}

The parameter \verb|q0| is included to match the Cook--Levin library’s
well-formedness predicate \verb|turing_machine k_tapes q0 M|.
All execution semantics used below start from the corresponding
\verb|start_config|.

section \<open>LR-read TM interface and lower bound inheritance\<close>

text \<open>
We now introduce the Cook--Levin--side LR-read interface and import the
abstract lower bound via \verb|SubsetSum_Reader_Model| (from
\verb|SubsetSum_DecisionTree|).

A Cook--Levin machine is considered polynomial-time on SUBSET-SUM if its
step count on an instance \verb|(as, s)| is bounded by some polynomial in
\verb|length as|.  We deliberately take \verb|length as| as the size
parameter and ignore the bit-length of \verb|enc as s| at this stage.

This choice aligns the Cook--Levin execution semantics with the abstract
decision-tree model used in \verb|SubsetSum_DecisionTree|.  It is not
intended to claim robustness under arbitrary encodings.  In particular,
this file does not attempt to relate \verb|length (enc as s)| to the
bit-length of the integers in \verb|as|.

These modelling assumptions are captured by the LR-read interface
introduced below.

definition polytime_CL_machine
  :: "machine ⇒ (int list ⇒ int ⇒ bool list) ⇒ bool"
where
  "polytime_CL_machine M enc ⟷
     (∃(c::real)>0. ∃(d::nat).
        ∀as s. steps_CL M (enc as s)
               ≤ nat (ceiling (c * (real (length as)) ^ d)))"

text \<open>
The size parameter used here is \verb|length as|, matching the abstract
decision-tree model.  We do not claim robustness under alternative
encodings or under bit-length measures.  This theory provides only a
bridge between the LR-read model and Cook--Levin execution semantics.
This is a modelling choice for the bridge, not a claim about standard
bit-complexity for SUBSET-SUM.

text \<open>
The locale \verb|LR_Read_TM| is the Cook--Levin analogue of
\verb|SubsetSum_Reader_Model|.  It assumes the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|M, q0, enc| form a SUBSET-SUM solver in the sense of
      \verb|CL_SubsetSum_Solver|.

\item For each instance \verb|(as, s)| with \verb|distinct_subset_sums as|,
      there exists a split index \verb|k| at which the abstract ``seen''
      sets \verb|seenL_TM| and \verb|seenR_TM| coincide with the canonical
      split sets
      \[
        \verb|LHS (e_k as s k) (length as)| \quad\text{and}\quad
        \verb|RHS (e_k as s k) (length as)|.
      \]

      That is, for some \verb|k \<le> length as| we postulate the equalities
      \[
        \verb|seenL_TM as s k| =
        \verb|LHS (e_k as s k) (length as)|,
      \]
      \[
        \verb|seenR_TM as s k| =
        \verb|RHS (e_k as s k) (length as)|.
      \]

      These equalities constitute the core LR-read assumption.  They assert
      that, at some split position \verb|k|, the machine's observable
      information flow covers exactly the canonical LHS/RHS candidate
      families.

      This is a strong LR-read requirement: at the critical split \verb|k|,
      the machine's information covers precisely the LHS/RHS families that
      drive the decision-tree lower bound, not merely a subset of them.
      The hypothesis is expressed as set equalities rather than inclusions,
      so that the abstract decision-tree lower bound transfers directly
      to the Cook--Levin setting.

\item For all \verb|as|, \verb|s|, and \verb|k|, the step count satisfies the
      lower bound
      \[
        \verb|steps_TM as s| \ge
        \verb|card (seenL_TM as s k)| +
        \verb|card (seenR_TM as s k)|.
      \]
\end{itemize}

These conditions are assumptions about the machine's information flow.
They are not derived from Cook--Levin execution semantics alone.  They
match exactly the abstract axioms of \verb|SubsetSum_Reader_Model| under
the identifications
\[
  \verb|steps = steps_TM|,\quad
  \verb|seenL = seenL_TM|,\quad
  \verb|seenR = seenR_TM|.
\]

Once the interpretation succeeds, the \(\sqrt{2^n}\) lower bound is
obtained specialised to the Cook--Levin step count of \verb|M|.  In
particular, this yields the impossibility of a single polynomial upper
bound on \verb|steps_TM| over all distinct-subset-sums instances.

From this point on, all lower-bound statements are inherited from

cost measures.

In particular, specialising
\verb|Reader.subset_sum_sqrt_lower_bound| yields the concrete lower bound
for \verb|steps_TM|.  This is the Turing-machine-level analogue of the
\(\sqrt{2^n}\) decision-tree lower bound.

We now show that no machine satisfying the LR-read assumptions can have its
step count bounded by a single polynomial over all instances with
\verb|distinct_subset_sums as|.  The proof combines the analytic lemma
\verb|exp_beats_poly_ceiling_strict_TM| with the
\(\sqrt{2^n}\) lower bound and the canonical distinct-subset-sums family
provided by \verb|exists_distinct_family_TM|.

The scope of this impossibility result is deliberately restricted:

\begin{itemize}
\item It is stated only for the subfamily of instances satisfying
      \verb|distinct_subset_sums as|.

\item It does \emph{not} assert that the machine \verb|M| fails to run in
      polynomial time on arbitrary inputs.  Rather, it rules out the
      existence of a \emph{single} polynomial bound that holds uniformly
      over all distinct-subset-sums instances.
\end{itemize}

This is exactly the quantitative content imported from
\verb|SubsetSum_DecisionTree| via \verb|SubsetSum_Reader_Model| and the
LR-read assumptions, and no stronger claim is made.

The same impossibility result can be restated directly in terms of the
underlying Cook--Levin step count \verb|steps_CL| on encoded instances.
This is the CL-level formulation used in the P~$\neq$~NP theory, captured

It states that, under the LR-read assumptions, there exists no single
polynomial that bounds \verb|steps_CL M (enc as s)| uniformly over all
