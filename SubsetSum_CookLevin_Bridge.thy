section ‹Cook–Levin bridge for the subset-sum lower bound›

text ‹
This theory connects the abstract decision-tree lower bound of
‹SubsetSum_DecisionTree› with the concrete operational semantics of
Turing machines, as defined in the AFP Cook_Levin library. The objective 
is structural: to express, within the Cook–Levin framework, the same 
per-candidate informational burden that drives the abstract √(2ⁿ) bound.

The development proceeds in several layers:

  • We define a time measure ‹steps_CL› and an acceptance predicate
    ‹accepts_CL› for Cook–Levin machines on Boolean inputs (written onto 
    tape 0 via ‹bool_to_symbols›).

  • Using these, we formalise SUBSET–SUM as a language in the Cook–Levin sense,
    and we give a verifier-based proof that SUBSET–SUM lies in ‹𝒩𝒫› for any
    reasonable instance encoding.

  • We introduce a locale ‹CL_SubsetSum_Solver› for a Turing machine ‹M› and
    encoding ‹enc› that together decide SUBSET–SUM correctly.  Inside this
    locale we obtain the specialised notions

          steps_TM as s = steps_CL M (enc as s),
          read0_TM as s = read0_CL M (enc as s),

    which serve as the concrete time and read measures.

  • Finally, the locale ‹LR_Read_TM› states the assumptions needed to align the
    observable behaviour of ‹M› with the canonical candidate sets used in the
    abstract lower bound.  Once these conditions are assumed, the abstract
    √(2ⁿ) bound transfers directly to ‹steps_TM› and hence to ‹steps_CL M›.

This theory makes no complexity-theoretic conclusions on its own; it provides
the interface connecting the reader model to the Cook–Levin semantics.
The conditional separation P ≠ NP is established later, in ‹SubsetSum_PneqNP›.

lemma length_pow2_list[simp]: "length (pow2_list n) = n"
  by (simp add: pow2_list_def)

text ‹
  For each length n we fix a canonical example with distinct subset sums,
  namely ‹pow2_list n›.  This family is convenient because for
  ‹as = pow2_list n› all 2^n subset sums are different, so it witnesses the
  existence of lists of length n with pairwise distinct subset sums.

  The lower-bound argument itself does not depend on any special hardness
  of powers of 2; it only uses the abstract assumption that for each n
  there exist lists ‹as› of length n with ‹distinct_subset_sums as›, as
  captured by ‹exists_distinct_family_TM›.

subsection ‹Cook–Levin step-count and acceptance›

text ‹
  We define a simple halting-time function ‹steps_CL› and an acceptance
  predicate ‹accepts_CL› for Cook–Levin machines:

    • ‹steps_CL M x› is the least step t where the control state index
      is at least ‹length M› (the halting convention of ‹Cook_Levin.NP›);

    • ‹conf_CL M x t› is the configuration after t steps on input x;

    • ‹accepts_CL M x› says that at time ‹steps_CL M x›, the symbol under
      the head on tape 1 is 3, i.e. the output tape contains the ‘1’ symbol 
      (3) under its head at halting time.

  These are purely “CL-level” notions: they talk about an arbitrary machine
  ‹M› run on an arbitrary Boolean string ‹x :: bool list›, with no reference
  yet to SUBSET-SUM or any specific encoding. These notions are intended for 
  machines that halt on the relevant inputs. In this development, halting is 
  supplied implicitly by the solver/time assumptions introduced later 
  (e.g. via an explicit halting assumption, or via a polynomial time-bound 
  hypothesis).

text ‹
  The predicate ‹accepts_CL_halt› is the notion of *correct acceptance*
  used when stating solver correctness.  It ensures that acceptance is
  only asserted for computations that actually halt, avoiding any
  ambiguity arising from partial or nonterminating executions.

  In particular, all solver correctness assumptions below are phrased
  in terms of ‹accepts_CL_halt› rather than ‹accepts_CL› alone.
›

text ‹
  We will reason about Cook–Levin machines mainly via ‹steps_CL› and
  ‹accepts_CL›, without unfolding the low-level configuration details.
  Later, in ‹CL_SubsetSum_Solver›, these CL-level notions are specialised
  to SUBSET-SUM instances (as, s) via an encoding ‹enc as s›, giving us
  ‹steps_TM› and ‹read0_TM›.

subsection ‹Which input bits does a Cook–Levin machine read?›

text ‹
  The set ‹read0_CL M x› collects all indices on the input tape (tape 0)
  that the head visits before halting on input x.  This abstracts away
  from the timing of visits and just records which input positions the
  machine has actually inspected.

  These CL-level read-sets are raw observations of machine behaviour on
  Boolean strings.  The LR-read interface in ‹LR_Read_TM› will later
  package this low-level reading behaviour into *canonical* «seen» sets
  on the SUBSET-SUM side, matching the LHS/RHS families at a suitable split.

subsection ‹The mathematical SUBSET-SUM predicate›

text ‹
  We now introduce the “true” SUBSET-SUM predicate, independent of any

  selecting a subset of ‹as› that sums to the target ‹s›.  This is the
  mathematical problem we want our CL machines to solve.

subsection ‹Certificate-based view of SUBSET-SUM›

text ‹
  A natural certificate for SUBSET–SUM is a 0/1-vector ‹xs› of length
  ‹length as› indicating which elements are chosen.  The predicate
  ‹ss_cert_ok as s xs› states that:

    • ‹xs› has the right length;
    • all entries are 0 or 1;
    • the weighted sum equals ‹s›.

  The next lemma shows that this certificate notion is equivalent to
  ‹subset_sum_true›.  This will later be used to prove that SUBSET–SUM is
  in NP via a verifier machine in the Cook–Levin framework.

subsection ‹SUBSET-SUM is in NP (via an abstract verifier)›

text ‹
  We now introduce an abstract verifier locale that matches the
  ‹Cook_Levin.NP› characterization of NP.

  A verifier instance consists of:

    • an instance encoding ‹enc0 :: int list ⇒ int ⇒ string›,
    • a certificate encoding ‹enc_cert :: int list ⇒ int ⇒ int list ⇒ string›,
    • a Turing machine ‹V› computing a function ‹fverify›,
    • a polynomial bound ‹p› on certificate length as a function of
      instance length, and
    • a time bound ‹T›.

  The locale assumptions express that ‹V› is a correct NP-style verifier
  for SUBSET-SUM with respect to ‹enc0› and ‹enc_cert›: any true instance has a
  certificate that leads to acceptance, and any accepting computation
  corresponds to a correct certificate.

  This gives the standard NP-membership statement:

      SUBSETSUM_lang enc0 ∈ 𝒩𝒫

  for any encoding ‹enc0› admitting such a verifier.

  step-count on an instance (as,s) is bounded by some polynomial in
  ‹length as› (we take ‹length as› as the size parameter and ignore the
  bit-length of ‹enc as s› here). This choice of size parameter is 
  deliberate: it aligns the Cook–Levin semantics with the abstract 
  decision-tree model used in ‹SubsetSum_DecisionTree›, and is not meant 
  to claim robustness under all encodings. In particular, this file does 
  not attempt to relate ‹length (enc as s)› to the bit-length of the 
  integers in ‹as›. This is captured by:

definition polytime_CL_machine
  :: "machine ⇒ (int list ⇒ int ⇒ bool list) ⇒ bool"
where
  "polytime_CL_machine M enc ⟷
     (∃(c::real)>0. ∃(d::nat).
        ∀as s. steps_CL M (enc as s)
               ≤ nat (ceiling (c * (real (length as)) ^ d)))"
text ‹
  The size parameter used here is ‹length as›, matching the abstract
  decision-tree model.  We do not claim robustness under alternative
  encodings or under bit-length measures; this theory only provides a
  bridge between the LR-read model and Cook–Levin execution semantics.

  The locale ‹LR_Read_TM› is the Cook–Levin analogue of ‹SubsetSum_Lemma1›.
  It assumes that:

    • ‹M, q0, enc› form a SUBSET-SUM solver in the sense of
      ‹CL_SubsetSum_Solver›;

    • for each instance (as,s) with distinct subset sums there exists
      a split index k at which the abstract “seen” sets ‹seenL_TM› and
      ‹seenR_TM› coincide with the canonical sets
      ‹LHS (e_k as s k) (length as)› and
      ‹RHS (e_k as s k) (length as)›;

      i.e. we postulate equalities

          seenL_TM as s k = LHS (e_k as s k) (length as)
          seenR_TM as s k = RHS (e_k as s k) (length as)

      for some k ≤ length as on each such instance.  This is the strong
      LR-read requirement: at the critical split ‹k›, the machine’s
      information flow covers exactly the LHS/RHS families that drive
      the decision-tree lower bound, not merely a subset of them. This is 
      a strong hypothesis, expressed as set equalities rather than
      inclusions, chosen so that the abstract decision-tree lower bound
      transfers without loss to the Cook–Levin setting.


    • for all as, s, k, the step-count is bounded below by

          steps_TM as s ≥ card (seenL_TM as s k) + card (seenR_TM as s k).

  These conditions are assumptions about the machine’s information flow; they
  are not derived from the Cook–Levin semantics alone. They match the abstract 
  axioms of ‹SubsetSum_Lemma1› with ‹steps = steps_TM› and ‹seenL = seenL_TM›, 
  ‹seenR = seenR_TM›.  Once the interpretation succeeds, we obtain the √(2ⁿ) 
  lower bound specialised to the Cook–Levin step-count of ‹M›, and in 
  particular the impossibility of a single polynomial upper bound on all 
  distinct-subset-sums instances.

  ‹SubsetSum_Lemma1› and applied to the Cook–Levin-specialised measures.

  Specialising ‹Reader.subset_sum_sqrt_lower_bound› yields the concrete
  lower bound for ‹steps_TM›.  This is the TM-level version of the
  √(2ⁿ) decision-tree bound.

  We now show that no machine satisfying the LR-read assumptions can have
  its step-count bounded by a single polynomial on all instances with distinct 
  subset sums. The proof combines the analytic lemma
   ‹exp_beats_poly_ceiling_strict_TM› with the √(2ⁿ) lower bound and the
  distinct-subset-sums family from ‹exists_distinct_family_TM›.

  Note carefully the scope of this impossibility result:

    • it is stated only for the subfamily of instances with
      ‹distinct_subset_sums as›;

    • it does **not** claim that ‹M› cannot be polynomial-time on arbitrary
      inputs; it only rules out a uniform polynomial bound that holds on
      *all* distinct-subset-sums inputs simultaneously.

  This is exactly the quantitative content imported from
  ‹SubsetSum_DecisionTree› via ‹SubsetSum_Lemma1› and the LR-read axioms.

  The same impossibility result can be restated directly in terms of the
  underlying Cook–Levin step-count ‹steps_CL› on encoded instances.  This
  is the CL-level version used in the P ≠ NP theory: the theorem
  ‹no_polytime_CL_on_distinct_family›.

  It says that no single polynomial bound can dominate ‹steps_CL M (enc as s)›
